API

This wiki page describes all available API functions.
Please contact Unwired Labs if you have any suggestions for improvement or bugs to report.

API key
Most of the API calls require an API key. This API key can be obtained by registering here.
All uploaded data will be stored along with this API key. This offers many functions, including the deletion of data from users that provide incorrect data.
It also allows the identification of users that are violating the community server usage policy.

Some smartphone apps also require an API key, for example the Tower Collector.

In the examples below "apiKey" is used as a place holder for this parameter.

WebServiceURL
The base URL (<WebServiceURL>) for the OpenCellID API service. This should be either http://opencellid.org or https://opencellid.org.
Note: HTTPS is recommended for secure communication.

"changeable" attribute
The meaning of the "changeable" value returned by some methods is the following:

some cell positions in the database are precise; for example, the GSM network provider O2 in Germany provides GPS information along with the Cell ID information and software is able to extract this information for OpenCellID.
in this case, new measurements for the cell are stored and shown on the map; however, their GPS positions are not used for calculating the GPS position of the cell tower.
changeable=1:
the GPS position of the cell tower has been calculated from all available measurements

changeable=0:
the GPS position of the cell tower is precise; no measurements have been used to calculate it.

Filtering of data
The following filters are currently applied to all incoming data and decide if a measurement is suspicious or valid.
Suspect data is inserted into a database table with suspect data which can be re-examined at a later stage if required.

Time needed for processing newly uploaded measurements
After uploading new measurements to the OpenCellID community servers they are added to our waiting queues and processed in the background. We aim the real-time processing, but maximum time depends on traffic on OpenCellID servers. Current throughput of our servers is around 15000 measurements per second.

Measurements are processed in 3 steps:

parsing and filtering raw data
updating measurement statistics and storing measurements in the database
updating existing cell towers information or adding new cell towers to the database
Our waiting queues for cell towers and for measurements are independent, so you can see your measurements in the OpenCellID database but related cell towers might be not updated yet. This means that if you upload a measurement of a cell tower that was not in the database before and the waiting queue for cell towers has some data to process, you have to expect some times (usually few minutes) until the queue delivers the newly uploaded cell tower information.

Uploading measurements from a CSV file

FAQ
What does "optional" mean?
"optional" means that this field is not required in the csv file.
Minimal csv file looks as follows:

mcc,mnc,lac,cellid,lon,lat
262,2,434,9200,9.436598,52.892139
What does "Supplemented by the parameter key=<apiKey> as form POST field, which is the user's API key" mean?
This means that the user must send his data (apiKey and csv file) in the same way as from the following form:

<form method="post" action="https://opencellid.org/measure/uploadCsv" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  apiKey: <input type="text" name="key" />
  CSV (max 2MB): <input type="file" name="datafile" />
  <input type="submit" name="upload" value="Upload"/>
</form>
What does the following error mean?

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rsp stat="fail"><err info="cell not found" code="1"/></rsp>
This error message means that no cell was found for the given user criteria (mcc-mnc-lac-cid combination was not found in database).

Can I upload CDMA using mcc-mnc-lac-cellid parameters?
Yes, you can use mnc as sid, lac as nid and cellid as bid.

Business logic
The request is handled by de.enaikoon.gpssuite.web.measure.NewMeasureController.

Time needed for processing newly uploaded measurements
After uploading new measurements to the OpenCellID community servers they are added to our waiting queues and processed in the background. We aim the real-time processing, but maximum time depends on traffic on OpenCellID servers. Current throughput of our servers is around 15000 measurements per second.

Measurements are processed in 3 steps:

parsing and filtering raw data
updating measurement statistics and storing measurements in the database
updating existing cell towers information or adding new cell towers to the database
Our waiting queues for cell towers and for measurements are independent, so you can see your measurements in the OpenCellID database but related cell towers might be not updated yet. This means that if you upload a measurement of a cell tower that was not in the database before and the waiting queue for cell towers has some data to process, you have to expect some times (usually few minutes) until the queue delivers the newly uploaded cell tower information.

Business logic
The request is handled by de.enaikoon.gpssuite.web.cell.CellController.
It uses de.enaikoon.m2m.gsmcellmanagment.dao.mongodb.GsmCellDao to calculate the average cell measurement, and builds an XML string to return to the user.
